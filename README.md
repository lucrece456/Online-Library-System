# Application Architecture Project - Online Library System

## Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the **IMAT3914 Application Architecture** module for the academic year 2023/24. The aim is to build a web-based **Online Library System** using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture in **Visual Studio 2022**, **ASP.NET**, and **C#**. The system provides users with an intuitive platform to browse, borrow, and review books online.

## Key Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users can create accounts by providing personal details.
   - Secure authentication ensures safe user login and management, with optional two-factor authentication.

2. **Book Catalogue:**
   - A comprehensive catalogue of available books, including titles, authors, genres, and availability status.
   - High-quality book covers and summaries enhance the user experience.

3. **Search and Filters:**
   - Users can search for books based on title, author, genre, or availability.
   - Filtering options allow users to narrow down results for better navigation.

4. **Check-out and Check-in System:**
   - Users can borrow and return books electronically.
   - The system includes due date reminders for borrowed books.

5. **User Profile and History:**
   - Each user has a dedicated profile page displaying their borrowing history and reserved books.
   - Personalized experience based on user preferences and history.

6. **Payment System:**
   - Online payment functionality for managing outstanding fines or fees.

7. **Rating and Review System:**
   - Users can rate and review books theyâ€™ve borrowed, with displayed ratings helping others make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core (MVC)**
- **C#**
- **Visual Studio 2022**
- **SQL Server** (for database management)

## Design and Architecture

- The project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, with the following components:
   - **Model**: Defines the data structures and logic for interacting with the database.
   - **View**: Renders the user interface and displays the data to the users.
   - **Controller**: Handles the user inputs, updates the model, and selects the appropriate view.

- **SOLID principles** and design patterns are followed to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- The system is designed with security best practices, including secure password handling and user input validation.

## Project Development

- The project has been built incrementally, starting with user authentication and expanding to include book management, borrowing systems, and user profiles.
- Automation scripts have been implemented for deployment and testing.
